           <p>To facilitate the implementation of “Vaccine Pass” arrangement, members of the public may use the latest version of the “LeaveHomeSafe” mobile application for storing the electronic vaccination record, Medical Exemption Certificate, recovery record and provisional vaccine pass at the same time and preset one of them as the default Vaccine Pass. Members of the public only need to save the latest relevant QR code to the "LeaveHomeSafe" mobile application.
           <br><br>When members of the public enter the premises subject to active checking, it is required to follow these two steps: 
           <br>(1) use the LeaveHomeSafe mobile application to scan the venue QR code; and
           <br> (2) show the Vaccine Pass to the premises’ QR Code Verification Scanner devices for checking and recording.</p>
